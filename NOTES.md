### Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- An AST, or Abstract Syntax Tree, is a structured representation of code primarily compilers use to read code and generate the target binaries. It is often stored as JSON.

- AST is generated during the syntax analysis phase of compilation. The parser takes the tokens produced by the lexical analysis phase and organizes them into a tree structure that reflects the hierarchical syntactic structure of the source code.
